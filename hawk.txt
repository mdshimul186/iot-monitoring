Hawk Pro PCB
 

Cellular Module 
 Nordic nRF9160 operates on all major global LTE-M and NB-IoT bands. 
Supported LTE bands:  
LTE-M (Cat-M1): B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B8, B12, B13, B14, B18, B19, B20, B25, B26, B28, B66  
NB-IoT (Cat-NB1/NB2): B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B8, B12, B13, B17, B19, B20, B25, B26, B28, B66  
 
SIM Size and Access 
 Internal Micro 3FF SIM 
 


 
 
 

Temperature Range 
 Operating: -30°C to +60°C 
Recommended Storage: 10°C to 30°C, Humidity 30%. Store in a cool, dry place. 
LiPo Charger: At <-10°C and >+45°C the internal backup battery will not be charged as a safety precaution due to the dangers associated with charging batteries at extreme temperatures. 
 
Self-Resetting Fuse 
 Built-in self-resetting fuse makes installation simple and safe. 
 
Cellular Antenna 
 Internal. Option to add high-gain external antenna. 
 
GPS Antenna 
 Internal 
 
3-Axis Accelerometer 
 3-Axis Accelerometer to detect tampering (planned in future firmware release). 
 
Diagnostic LED 
 2 Diagnostic LEDs and Push Button for testing and operational status. 
 
Flash Memory 
 Store records if device is out of cellular coverage. View storage capacity here. 
 
Onboard Temperature 
 The device reports internal temperature and prevents the internal battery from charging in extreme temperatures. Internal temperature provides an indication of ambient temperature but may 
 


not always be precise. Use an external sensor for precise temperature monitoring. 
 


 
Onboard Location 
  
 

Module 
 Nordic nRF9160 internal GPS 
 
Constellation 
 GPS 
 
Location Accuracy* 
 ~3m CEP 
 
GNSS Assistance 
 GPS predicted ephemeris data for greater sensitivity and position accuracy. 
 
Low Noise Amplifier 
 GPS signals are boosted by a low-noise amplifier (LNA) allowing operation in low signal. 
 
* Positioning accuracy specifications are provided by the module supplier and reflect ideal conditions. Device configuration, installation, environmental conditions, augmentation services, and many other factors may lead to variations in positioning accuracy.
